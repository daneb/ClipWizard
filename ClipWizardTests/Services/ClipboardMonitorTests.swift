    /*
     Testing the ClipboardMonitor requires special considerations:
     
     1. The ClipboardMonitor interacts with system clipboard which can be challenging to mock
     2. It may have private methods and properties that aren't accessible in tests
     3. It may depend on other services that need to be mocked
     
     For thorough testing, consider:
     
     1. Refactoring the class to use dependency injection for its services
     2. Creating interfaces for system interactions that can be mocked
     3. Making certain properties/methods internal or public for testing
     4. Using a testable subclass that overrides private methods
     
     For now, we'll limit tests to basic compilation verification.
