    /*
     Testing the HotkeyManager requires special considerations:
     
     1. The HotkeyManager may use system APIs that are difficult to mock
     2. It may register global event handlers that can't be easily verified in a test environment
     3. The class may use private or internal components that are not accessible in tests
     
     For thorough testing, consider:
     
     1. Creating a test-specific subclass or protocol for testability
     2. Using dependency injection to replace system calls with mockable interfaces
     3. Adding specific hooks for testing status of registered hotkeys
     
     For now, we'll limit tests to basic compilation verification.
