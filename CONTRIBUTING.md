## Coding Guidelines

### Swift Style Guide

- Follow the [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/)
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add documentation comments for public methods and types
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task
- Use Swift's strong typing to prevent errors

### SwiftUI Best Practices

- Separate view logic from business logic
- Create reusable view components
- Use appropriate property wrappers (@State, @Binding, @ObservedObject, etc.)
- Follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines for macOS

### Git Workflow

- Keep commits small and focused on a single change
- Write clear commit messages:
  - Start with a verb in present tense (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update")
  - First line should be a summary under 72 characters
  - Optionally followed by a blank line and a more detailed explanation
- Rebase your branch if needed before submitting a PR

## Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Ensure existing tests pass with your changes
- Test your changes on multiple macOS versions if possible

## Documentation

When adding new features or making significant changes, please update the relevant documentation:

- Update README.md if applicable
