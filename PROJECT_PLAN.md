# ClipWizard Project Plan

This document outlines the development roadmap, architecture, and implementation details for ClipWizard, a macOS clipboard manager with advanced sanitization capabilities.

## Project Overview

ClipWizard is designed to serve as a powerful clipboard management tool for macOS users, particularly engineers and developers who frequently work with sensitive information. The app monitors clipboard activity, maintains a history of copied items, and provides tools to automatically sanitize sensitive data.

## Core Requirements

- [x] **Clipboard Monitoring**: Automatically track all clipboard activity
- [x] **Sanitization**: Detect and sanitize sensitive information like passwords, API keys, etc.
- [x] **User Interface**: Provide an intuitive interface for accessing clipboard history and managing settings
- [x] **Extensibility**: Allow users to create and manage their own sanitization rules
- [ ] **Performance**: Ensure minimal system impact while running in the background

## Architecture

### 1. Data Models

#### ClipboardItem
- [x] Properties: ID, timestamp, content type (text/image), original content, sanitized content
- [x] Responsible for representing individual clipboard entries

#### SanitizationRule
- [x] Properties: ID, name, pattern (regex), rule type, replacement value, enabled status
- [x] Responsible for defining how specific types of sensitive data should be handled

### 2. Services

#### ClipboardMonitor
- [x] Monitor clipboard changes and detect content type
- [x] Add items to history with proper metadata
- [x] Manage history size according to user preferences
- [x] Provide methods to clear history and copy items back to clipboard

#### SanitizationService
- [x] Apply sanitization rules using regex patterns
- [x] Manage different sanitization types (mask, rename, obfuscate, remove)
- [x] Provide CRUD operations for rules
- [x] Save/load rules from UserDefaults

#### HotkeyManager
- [x] Base implementation for registering system-wide keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Connect hotkeys to app functionality
- [ ] Provide user interface for customizing shortcuts

### 3. User Interface

#### Main Views
- [x] ClipboardHistoryView: Display and search clipboard history
- [x] SettingsView: Configure app behavior and manage sanitization rules
- [x] RuleEditView: Create and edit sanitization rules

#### Components
- [x] ClipboardItemRow: Display individual clipboard items in the history list
- [x] ClipboardItemDetailView: Show detailed view of clipboard items
- [x] Tab-based navigation for settings
- [x] Menu bar integration with dropdown menu

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Foundation ‚úÖ
- [x] Set up project structure and basic macOS app
- [x] Implement core data models (ClipboardItem, SanitizationRule)
- [x] Create menu bar integration with status item
- [x] Implement clipboard monitoring service
- [x] Develop sanitization logic with regex pattern matching

### Phase 2: User Interface ‚úÖ
- [x] Design and implement clipboard history view with search
- [x] Create settings panel with tab navigation
- [x] Build rule management interface
- [x] Implement sanitization rule editing
- [x] Add UI for configuring app preferences
- [x] Fix UI layout and positioning for popovers

### Phase 3: Features Enhancement üîÑ
- [ ] Complete keyboard shortcut support
  - [x] Core HotkeyManager implementation
  - [ ] Connect hotkeys to app functions
  - [ ] Implement hotkey customization UI
- [ ] Launch-at-login functionality
  - [ ] Implement service registration with macOS
  - [ ] Add toggle in settings
- [ ] Import/export functionality for rules
  - [ ] Add export to JSON/plist
  - [ ] Add import from file
- [ ] Advanced image handling
  - [x] Basic image display in history
  - [ ] Image preview enhancements
  - [ ] Potential OCR integration (future)

### Phase 4: Testing & Optimization ‚è≥
- [ ] Performance testing with large clipboard histories
- [ ] Memory usage optimization
- [ ] Add automated tests
  - [ ] Unit tests for services
  - [ ] UI tests for main interactions
- [ ] User testing and feedback collection

### Phase 5: Release Preparation ‚è≥
- [ ] App distribution preparation
  - [ ] Code signing
  - [ ] Notarization
- [ ] App icon and branding design
- [ ] Complete documentation
  - [x] README
  - [x] Project plan
  - [ ] User guide

## Technical Considerations

### Privacy & Security
- [x] No network access for clipboard data
- [x] Local-only processing
- [x] Secure storage of clipboard history
- [ ] Potential automatic clearing of sensitive data after time period

### Performance
- [x] Optimized clipboard monitoring
- [x] Efficient regex matching implementation
- [ ] Performance testing with large histories
- [ ] Memory usage optimization

### Compatibility
- [x] Target macOS Ventura (13.0) and later
- [ ] Verify compatibility with Apple Silicon and Intel Macs
