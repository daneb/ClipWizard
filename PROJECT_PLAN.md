# ClipWizard Project Plan

This document outlines the development roadmap, architecture, and implementation details for ClipWizard, a macOS clipboard manager with advanced sanitization capabilities.

## Project Overview

ClipWizard is designed to serve as a powerful clipboard management tool for macOS users, particularly engineers and developers who frequently work with sensitive information. The app monitors clipboard activity, maintains a history of copied items, and provides tools to automatically sanitize sensitive data.

## Core Requirements

1. **Clipboard Monitoring**: Automatically track all clipboard activity
2. **Sanitization**: Detect and sanitize sensitive information like passwords, API keys, etc.
3. **User Interface**: Provide an intuitive interface for accessing clipboard history and managing settings
4. **Extensibility**: Allow users to create and manage their own sanitization rules
5. **Performance**: Ensure minimal system impact while running in the background

## Architecture

### 1. Data Models

#### ClipboardItem
- Properties: ID, timestamp, content type (text/image), original content, sanitized content
- Responsible for representing individual clipboard entries

#### SanitizationRule
- Properties: ID, name, pattern (regex), rule type, replacement value, enabled status
- Responsible for defining how specific types of sensitive data should be handled

### 2. Services

#### ClipboardMonitor
- Responsibilities: Monitor clipboard changes, add items to history, manage history size
- Dependencies: SanitizationService

#### SanitizationService
- Responsibilities: Apply sanitization rules, manage rule collection, save/load rules
- Dependencies: SanitizationRule models

#### HotkeyManager
- Responsibilities: Register/handle system-wide keyboard shortcuts
- Dependencies: None

### 3. User Interface

#### Main Views
- ClipboardHistoryView: Display and search clipboard history
- SettingsView: Configure app behavior and manage sanitization rules
- RuleEditView: Create and edit sanitization rules

#### Components
- ClipboardItemRow: Display individual clipboard items in the history list
- ClipboardItemDetailView: Show detailed view of clipboard items

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Completed)
- [x] Set up project structure and basic macOS app
- [x] Implement core data models
- [x] Create basic menu bar integration
- [x] Implement clipboard monitoring service
- [x] Develop sanitization logic

### Phase 2: User Interface (Completed)
- [x] Design and implement clipboard history view
- [x] Create settings panel
- [x] Build rule management interface
- [x] Implement rule testing functionality

### Phase 3: Features Enhancement (In Progress)
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcut support
- [ ] Implement launch-at-login functionality
- [ ] Create import/export functionality for rules
- [ ] Add advanced image handling

### Phase 4: Testing & Optimization (Planned)
- [ ] Perform performance testing with large clipboard histories
- [ ] Optimize memory usage
- [ ] Add automated tests
- [ ] Conduct user testing

### Phase 5: Release Preparation (Planned)
- [ ] Prepare app for distribution
- [ ] Create documentation
- [ ] Design app icon and branding
- [ ] Set up website or landing page

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Testing**: Test individual components (services, models)
2. **Integration Testing**: Test interactions between components
3. **Performance Testing**: Ensure app remains responsive with large clipboard histories
4. **User Testing**: Gather feedback on usability and features

## Technical Considerations

### Privacy & Security
- The app will not send clipboard data over the network
- All processing happens locally on the user's device
- Sanitized data is only stored in memory unless explicitly saved by the user

### Performance
- Optimize clipboard monitoring to minimize CPU usage
- Implement efficient regex matching
- Use lazy loading for clipboard history items

### Compatibility
- Target macOS Ventura (13.0) and later
- Ensure compatibility with Apple Silicon and Intel Macs

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Hotkey Support**: Allow users to trigger clipboard history via keyboard shortcuts
2. **Add Launch-at-Login**: Enable automatic startup when the user logs in
3. **Create Rule Import/Export**: Allow users to share sanitization rules
4. **Develop Advanced Image Handling**: Add OCR for text in images, image resizing, etc.

## Milestones

1. **Alpha Release** (Early Testing)
   - Core functionality working
   - Basic UI implemented
   - Limited rule set

2. **Beta Release** (Feature Complete)
   - All planned features implemented
   - UI polished
   - Performance optimized

3. **1.0 Release** (Public Launch)
   - Bug fixes from beta testing
   - Documentation complete
   - Distribution ready
