The app is functional and can be used for its primary purposes of clipboard monitoring and sanitization.

## Project Overview

ClipWizard is designed to serve as a powerful clipboard management tool for macOS users, particularly engineers and developers who frequently work with sensitive information. The app monitors clipboard activity, maintains a history of copied items, and provides tools to automatically sanitize sensitive data.

## Core Requirements

- [x] **Clipboard Monitoring**: Automatically track all clipboard activity
- [x] **Sanitization**: Detect and sanitize sensitive information like passwords, API keys, etc.
- [x] **User Interface**: Provide an intuitive interface for accessing clipboard history and managing settings
- [x] **Extensibility**: Allow users to create and manage their own sanitization rules
- [x] **Performance**: Ensure minimal system impact while running in the background
- [x] **Persistence**: Maintain clipboard history across app restarts

## Architecture

### 1. Data Models

#### ClipboardItem

- [x] Properties: ID, timestamp, content type (text/image), original content, sanitized content
- [x] Responsible for representing individual clipboard entries

#### SanitizationRule

- [x] Properties: ID, name, pattern (regex), rule type, replacement value, enabled status
- [x] Responsible for defining how specific types of sensitive data should be handled

### 2. Services

#### ClipboardMonitor

- [x] Monitor clipboard changes and detect content type
- [x] Add items to history with proper metadata
- [x] Manage history size according to user preferences
- [x] Provide methods to clear history and copy items back to clipboard

#### SanitizationService

- [x] Apply sanitization rules using regex patterns
- [x] Manage different sanitization types (mask, rename, obfuscate, remove)
- [x] Provide CRUD operations for rules
- [x] Save/load rules from UserDefaults

#### HotkeyManager

- [x] Base implementation for registering system-wide keyboard shortcuts
- [x] Connect hotkeys to app functionality
- [x] Provide user interface for customizing shortcuts

### 3. User Interface

#### Main Views

- [x] ClipboardHistoryView: Display and search clipboard history
- [x] SettingsView: Configure app behavior and manage sanitization rules
- [x] RuleEditView: Create and edit sanitization rules

#### Components

- [x] ClipboardItemRow: Display individual clipboard items in the history list
- [x] ClipboardItemDetailView: Show detailed view of clipboard items
- [x] ImagePreviewOverlay: Show image previews on hover
- [x] Tab-based navigation for settings
- [x] Menu bar integration with dropdown menu
