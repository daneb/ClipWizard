# ClipWizard Memory Optimization Checklist

This document tracks memory optimization tasks for the ClipWizard application to address the growing memory footprint issue.

## Memory Issues

- [x] Fix notification observation memory leaks - _Fixed by properly removing observers in deinit and using weak self references_
- [x] Implement lazy loading for images - _Updated ClipboardItem to support image references and lazy loading_
- [x] Add memory warning handling and cleanup - _Implemented macOS-specific memory pressure handling and monitoring_
- [x] Implement text memory management - _Added text lazy loading similar to images for large text items_
- [x] Enhance SQLite database memory efficiency - _Optimized database connection settings and statement cache management_
- [x] Implement tiered memory management - _Added 3-tier system for efficient memory usage based on item age_
- [x] Add progressive memory pressure response - _Created light/medium/severe memory pressure handlers with escalating actions_
- [x] Optimize image processing with autoreleasepools - _Wrapped image operations in autoreleasepools to free temporary resources_
- [x] Add resource limits - _Implemented OS-level memory limits and monitoring_

## Details

### Notification Observation Memory Leaks

Memory leaks can occur when notification observers aren't properly removed, especially if they capture `self` strongly.

### Image Handling

Large images in memory contribute significantly to memory usage. Implement lazy loading and proper cleanup.

### Database Connection Management

Improve SQLite connection handling to prevent leaks and deadlocks.

### Memory Warning Handling

Add handlers for memory pressure notifications from the OS.

### Clipboard Monitoring

Optimize the timer frequency and add autoreleasepools.

### Text Compression

Improve the compression algorithm efficiency.
