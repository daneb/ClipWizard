# Memory Optimization Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the memory optimization changes implemented to address the memory issues identified in the ClipWizard application.

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Fixed Notification Observation Memory Leaks

- Added proper tracking of notification observers in both ClipboardMonitor and EnhancedClipboardMonitor
- Implemented cleanup in deinit methods to remove all registered observers
- Used weak self references in all notification handlers and closures to prevent retain cycles

### 2. Implemented Lazy Loading for Images

- Enhanced ClipboardItem to support lazy loading of image content
- Added image unloading and reloading capabilities using both file storage and memory compression
- Implemented asynchronous image loading and unloading with proper callbacks
- Added automatic image file storage to minimize memory usage

### 3. Added Memory Warning Handling and Cleanup

- Implemented macOS-specific memory pressure monitoring using DispatchSourceMemoryPressure
- Created a custom extension to handle memory pressure events correctly on macOS
- Used ProcessInfo's thermal state to detect system resource constraints
- Fixed iOS-specific API usage and replaced with macOS-appropriate alternatives

### 4. Implemented Text Memory Management

- Added text compression mechanism for large text items
- Implemented on-demand decompression when text is needed
- Used the Compression framework with LZFSE algorithm for efficient compression
- Added threshold-based compression to only compress text that exceeds size limits

### 5. Enhanced Resource Cleanup

- Added proper cleanup method to ClipboardItem to release resources
- Implemented automatic deletion of image files when items are removed
- Added clearing of circular references to prevent memory leaks
- Enhanced the DeleteItem method to trigger resource cleanup

### 6. Optimized Processing with Autoreleasepools

- Wrapped image processing operations in autoreleasepools
- Added autoreleasepools around clipboard monitoring operations
- Used autoreleasepools in memory cleanup procedures
- Moved database operations to background threads

### 7. Added Memory Usage Monitoring

- Created MemoryUsageMonitor utility for debugging memory issues
- Added periodic logging of memory usage for performance analysis
- Implemented proper memory tracking using Mach API

## Memory Management Strategy

The implementation follows a tiered memory management approach:

1. **Proactive Management**:
   - Large images are immediately stored to disk with references kept for later access
   - Text and image data are compressed when not actively in use
   - Database operations run asynchronously on background threads
   - Long-lived objects use weak references to prevent circular dependencies

2. **Reactive Pressure Handling**:
   - Warning Level: Unloads non-essential resources (older images, compress large text)
   - Critical Level: Aggressively unloads resources and trims history
   - Uses macOS-specific thermal state information to detect system constraints

3. **User Experience Preservation**:
   - Recently used items remain in memory for quick access
   - Progressively unloads older items as they become less likely to be needed
   - Visual indicators for loading state maintain UI responsiveness
   - Asynchronous loading prevents UI freezing

## Benefits

These optimizations significantly improve memory management in ClipWizard:

1. **Reduced Memory Footprint**: Storage of images on disk instead of memory
2. **Better Performance Under Pressure**: Graceful degradation during low memory conditions
3. **Improved Reliability**: Avoids crashes from memory pressure conditions
4. **Smooth User Experience**: Background loading/unloading maintains UI responsiveness
5. **Lower Resource Usage**: More efficient use of system resources overall
