# Memory Monitoring Implementation Update

This document explains the updated approach to memory pressure monitoring in the ClipWizard application, addressing compilation errors found in the previous implementation.

## Identified Issues

1. **Extension Method Errors**: The extension method `makeMemoryPressureEventMask()` on `DispatchSourceMemoryPressure` was causing compilation errors.

2. **Notification Observer Access**: The `notificationObservers` array wasn't properly declared in the `EnhancedClipboardMonitor` class.

3. **Memory Pressure Source Access**: The `memoryPressureSource` property wasn't being stored or wasn't accessible in the expected scope.

## Implementation Changes

### 1. Direct Implementation vs. Extension

Instead of using an extension on DispatchSourceMemoryPressure to add the `makeMemoryPressureEventMask()` method, we've implemented this functionality directly in each class that needs it:

- Moved the logic to a private method `getCurrentMemoryPressure()` in both ClipboardMonitor and EnhancedClipboardMonitor
- This approach avoids type extension compilation issues and keeps the functionality encapsulated where it's needed

### 2. Proper Class Properties

- Added explicit `notificationObservers` property to the EnhancedClipboardMonitor class
- Added explicit `memoryPressureSource` property to store the dispatch source
- Ensured proper initialization and cleanup in both the init and deinit methods

### 3. Memory Pressure Detection

- Simplified the approach to use ProcessInfo.thermalState on macOS 10.15+
- Added proper handling of memory pressure events directly in the event handler
- Implemented proper cleanup in deinit methods to prevent memory leaks

### 4. Documentation

- Added comments explaining the approach and rationale
- Added warning/error handling for edge cases
- Ensured consistent implementation across both monitor classes

## Benefits of the New Approach

1. **Direct Implementation**: Avoids issues with Swift extension type checking
2. **Self-Contained**: Each class manages its own memory pressure detection
3. **Simplified Code**: Clearer implementation without unnecessary abstraction
4. **Consistent Behavior**: Both monitor classes handle memory pressure in the same way
5. **Better Resource Management**: Explicit cleanup in deinit methods

This updated implementation maintains all the functionality of the previous approach while resolving the compilation errors and improving code organization.
