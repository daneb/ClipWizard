# Memory Monitoring Implementation Fix

This document explains the changes made to fix the memory pressure monitoring system in the ClipWizard application.

## Issues Addressed

1. **Incorrect Notification Name**: The previous implementation used `NSApplication.didReceiveMemoryWarningNotification`, which doesn't exist on macOS. This API is iOS-specific.

2. **Invalid Property Access**: The code was attempting to access `memoryEventMask` on a DispatchSourceMemoryPressure, which isn't available on macOS.

## Implementation Changes

### 1. System Monitoring Approach

Instead of relying on iOS-specific APIs, the implementation now uses macOS-appropriate methods:

- **Thermal State Monitoring**: On macOS 10.15 and later, we use the `ProcessInfo.thermalState` property to assess system resource constraints.
  
- **Workspace Notifications**: We monitor relevant system events like when the machine wakes from sleep, which often indicates potential resource constraints.

- **DispatchSource Memory Pressure**: We continue to use DispatchSource.makeMemoryPressureSource() but with a custom helper function that interprets the pressure levels correctly on macOS.

### 2. Custom Helper Extension

Added a `makeMemoryPressureEventMask()` extension method to provide a cross-platform compatible way to determine memory pressure levels:

- Uses thermal state information when available
- Provides graceful fallbacks for older macOS versions
- Returns appropriate memory pressure levels (.normal, .warning, or .critical)

### 3. Simplification

The implementation was significantly simplified to:

- Remove complex Mach kernel API calls
- Eliminate potential memory leaks from incorrectly managed buffers
- Provide more reliable monitoring based on system thermal state

## Benefits

1. **Platform Compatibility**: The code now works correctly on macOS by using macOS-specific APIs
2. **Reliability**: Eliminates error-prone low-level memory calculations
3. **Maintainability**: Simplified code that's easier to understand and maintain
4. **Robustness**: Better error handling with appropriate fallbacks

This new implementation ensures that ClipWizard can properly monitor system resources and respond appropriately to memory pressure situations, enhancing the application's stability and performance under constrained conditions.
